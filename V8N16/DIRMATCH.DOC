DIRMATCH.COM
Command

Michael J. Mefford                    September 26, 1989 (Utilities)


Purpose:	To display two scrollable, alphabetized, directory listings 
side-by-side, with the more recent of matching filenames highlighted; 
to provide mark, copy, and move facilities to update the target 
directory with one or more selected files from the source.

Format:	DIRMATCH source target [/D][/A]

Remarks:	The source and target may comprise any 
combination of drives, directories, or subdirectories 
(with optional * and ? wildcards) valid for the DOS DIR 
command.  The user will be prompted for target and 
source directories if his entry is incorrect.  By 
default,  DIRMATCH displays all files in the two 
directories.  The optional /D and /A switches restrict 
the display to Different and Alike files, respectively.  
The on-screen display, together with the number-of-
files counters, can be cycled through All, Different, 
and Alike modes with F1; Shift-F1 cycles in reverse.  
Pressing Esc exits the utility. Crtl-C will abort the 
program operation.

	An inverse-video selector bar shows the current 
position in the listings, and may be moved with the 
UpArrow, DownArrow, PgUp, PgDn, Home, and End keys.  
When the selector bar is on a filename, pressing the 
plus (+) key on the keypad or the +/= key on the 
keyboard marks the file for further action.  Pressing 
the minus (-) key on the keypad or the _/- key on the 
keyboard unmarks a marked file.  F2 marks all files; F3 
clears all marks.

	A file under the selector-bar or a group of 
marked files can be copied from source to target 
directories by pressing F4.  A confirming prompt is 
provided.  Similarly, pressing F5 moves a file or 
marked group, by first copying and then deleting 
file(s) from the source.  While older files can be 
copied (F4) to the target directory, by default F5 will 
not move them.  (See Customization Note).
	
 	Pressing F6 prints a list of All files, with 
more recent matching filenames identified with a 
greater-than (>) sign.  

	DIRMATCH supports any number of screen display 
lines, including 43-line (EGA) and 50-line (VGA) modes.  
It can display up to 1,423 filesnames in its listings.  
Hidden and read-only files are not displayed.  DIRMATCH 
requires 64K free RAM in order to run.

	Customization Note:  A sidebar to the original 
article provides DEBUG instructions for changing the 
display colors, for removing the move-over-existing 
file protection, and for adding printer control codes 
to display highlighted files in boldface rather than 
with a greater-than sign.
