CHKFRAG
Command

Bob Flanders and Michael Holmes
August, 1989 (Utilities)


Purpose:	To report, on-screen, the extent of file fragmentation on a hard
disk, and provide an ERRORLEVEL value usable within a batch file to call a
defragmenting program.  

Format:	CHKFRAG [d:] [/% | /N | /E] [/L]

Remarks:	Executed without any of its optional parameters, CHKFRAG
produces a screen report indicating the number of files and directories, how
many and what percentage of these are fragmented, and how many extra (non-
contiguously stored) parts of files are contained on the currently-logged drive.
An ERRORLEVEL code from 0-100, reflecting the percentage of fragmented files,
(the /% parameter is the default) is also shown.

	An alternative drive (d:) to be analyzed may be specified, as may be
ERRORLEVEL return codes that reflect the actual number of fragmented files (the
/N parameter) or of extra sections (the /E parameter).  The ERRORLEVEL return
codes are not intended for strict accuracy:  if any file is fragmented the
minimum ERRORLEVEL returned by the /% parameter is 1%, and 254 is the maximum
ERRORLEVEL returned by the /N and /E switch options.  These return codes are
intended to be used to trigger automatic loading and execution of the user's
defragmenting utility from within a batch file.  An ERRORLEVEL return code of
255 is used to indicate an error condition, which halts operation.

	If desired, a list of the names of fragmented files and directories can
be produced by specifying the optional /L parameter.  The normal screen output
from CHKFRAG may be redirected to a file or to a printer, for easier analysis.

	The DOS CHKDSK command, specified with its /F switch, should be executed
before running CHKFRAG; lost clusters or cross-linked files are interpreted by
CHKFRAG as a error condition.  Drives created with the DOS ASSIGN or SUBST
commands, and directories created by JOIN, are not checked by CHKFRAG.  While
analyzing large disks, the utility requires approximately 100KB of available
RAM.  On-screen recommendations are to consider using a defragmenting utility
when file fragmentation is in the range from 11% to 75%, and definitely to
defragment disks that show more than 75% fragmentation. 

	CHKFRAG.EXE was written in the C language and its source code should be
compiled using the Microsoft C Compiler, Version 5.0 or later.
