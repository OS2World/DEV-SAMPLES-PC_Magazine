DEBUGSCR
Command

Michael Mefford  November 28, 1989 (Utilities)


Purpose: To convert binary files into ordinary ASCII text files, which can be
         transmitted over MCI Mail and similar services, and reconverted to the
         ir original binary form using the DOS DEBUG command.

Format:	DEBUGSCR filespec [/N]
	DEBUG < filename

Remarks: Use the first command shown above to create a DEBUGSCR script file 
         from a binary file (.COM, .EXE, .WK1, etc.) named in the filespec. 
         An alternate drive and/or path may be specified.  The script file is
         automatically given an .SCR extension and is placed in the same 
         directory as the original file.  The script file consists of an ASCII
         hex representation of the original binary values, together with the 
         commands DEBUG needs to recreate the original file.  The script file 
         ends with appropriate instructions to the recipient.  These 
         instructions are ignored by DEBUG and can be suppressed altogether 
         by using the optional /N switch.

	 The .SCR file can be edited with a word processor before transmission
         to append additional information, such as how to use the utility being
         sent.  The .SCR file must then be resaved in pure ASCII form.  
         Similarly, before he reconverts the .SCR file with DEBUG.COM, the 
         recipient must edit out any header prefixed to the file by the 
         communications service (for example, the TO: heading added by MCI). 
         After resaving in ASCII, the recipient simply uses the second command
         line shown above, supplying the desired final filename.

         DEBUGSCR.BAS will automatically create DEBUGSCR.COM when run once in 
         BASIC.  To assemble the program from its source code listing requires 
         use of a macro assembler (IBM or Microsoft, Version 2 or later) and the
         following commands:
 
    	MASM DEBUGSCR;
	LINK DEBUGSCR;
	EXE2BIN DEBUGSCR DEBUGSCR.COM;

Note:   DEBUGSCR will not work with files over 60K.  

	DEBUG.COM will not write a filename with an .EXE extension to disk.  
        DEBUGSCR therefore strips this extension and appends a warning to the 
        recipient that after using DEBUG he must rename the file to include its
        proper .EXE extension.
